								<!--	<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">Signal processing has a rich history of use in various fields, including modification, prediction, transformation, and numerical analysis. With the rise of computers, however, it has become evident that signal processing algorithms have the potential to do much more. As a result, modern mathematicians have created a variety of digital signal processing algorithms, including the Fast Fourier Transform, Z-Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, and others. These algorithms are now widely used in a range of computing applications, enabling advanced analysis and processing of digital signals. In this reflection, I will discuss my experience studying the course Digital Signal Processing and the insights I gained into the principles and practical applications of these algorithms.</br></br>
									When I first considered taking the Digital Signal Processing course, I was hesitant because I had already studied a similar course during my bachelor's studies. However, after speaking with Professor <strong>Dr. Aldy T. Fam</strong>, I discovered that the course had been updated to include modern applications and was structured in a way that would offer a more in-depth understanding of the topics. In particular, I was excited about the opportunity to complete a guided project in the field, which would provide valuable experience for my future job applications. Ultimately, I decided to enrol in the course and have found the experience to be both challenging and rewarding.</br></br>
									The initial portion of the Digital Signal Processing course focused on revising the fundamental concepts of Signals and Systems. We covered both continuous and discrete time signals and their properties, as well as various signal spaces such as Banach Spaces and Hilbert Spaces for both continuous and discrete time signals. By reviewing these fundamental concepts, we were able to establish a solid foundation for understanding the more advanced topics that were to follow. Additionally, this revision helped me refresh my knowledge of the basics and clarified some of the concepts that I had previously found challenging.</br></br>
									One of the most fascinating aspects of the Digital Signal Processing course for me was our in-depth study of the Fourier Transform. This algorithm is, in my opinion, one of the most ingenious of the 20th century. It has proven to be an indispensable tool in many areas of modern technology, including wireless communication and GPS, and its insights have revolutionized the field of signal processing. As we delved into the Fourier Transform, I found myself captivated by its ability to exchange the view between the time and frequency domains. Watching Dr. Fam teach this concept was like witnessing a magic trick - it opened my mind to new ways of thinking and seeing the world. Through this experience, I learned that a complex problem can become much clearer when viewed from a different perspective. Overall, this was one of the most influential classes of my life, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have studied this ground-breaking algorithm in such depth.</br></br>
</p>

							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">Fig. 1 The Fourier Transform of some basic Signals </p>
							 <p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify">After our study of the Fourier Transform, we delved into the topic of filter design. We learned about important concepts such as causality, frequency-selective filters, finite impulse response (FIR) filters, and bandpass filters. Through this portion of the course, we explored the practical applications of different filter types and how they can be used in real-world scenarios. In addition to these fundamental topics, we also covered more advanced concepts such as the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Multiresolution Analysis, and the Two-Dimensional Cases of various signal processing techniques. While some of these advanced topics were challenging to grasp, I found that the guidance of Dr. Fam and my classmates made them more accessible. In particular, the Multiresolution Analysis opened my eyes to new ways of understanding and processing signals, and the Two-Dimensional Cases added a whole new level of complexity to my understanding of signal processing. Overall, I found this portion of the course to be intellectually stimulating and highly relevant to modern signal processing applications.</br></br>
								One of the most surprising and exciting technologies I learned from DSP is the use of error correction in radio transmission. The history of transmitting speech signals in digital form dates back to the 1960s with the development of pulse code modulation (PCM) technology. This technology utilized an analog-to-digital converter with a sampling frequency of 8kHz and a 16-bit quantizer to produce a digital signal with a bit rate of 128kbps. However, transmitting digital signals with higher bit rates was not efficient. In response, several technologies were developed to reduce the bit rate of speech signals without compromising quality, such as sub-band coding in 1977 and Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) in 1982. CELP is still widely used today due to its efficient use of available bandwidth and high-quality output. Through the study of these technologies, I gained a greater understanding of how digital signal processing is used in real-world applications to improve the efficiency and quality of information transmission.</br></br>
								One of the highlights of this course was the academic project that challenged me to apply DSP concepts to real-world problems. I developed a Fingerprint Image Restoration and Classification program that estimated the point spread function for blurry fingerprint images and used blur modelling and deconvolution techniques in the frequency domain for image restoration. I then employed Convolutional Neural Networks for gender-based classification, achieving an impressive 98% accuracy. This project showcased the versatility of DSP concepts and their practical applications beyond their traditional domains. It was a truly rewarding experience that demonstrated the immense potential of DSP in solving complex problems in diverse fields.</br></br>

								In conclusion, DSP is undoubtedly a challenging course, but with the help of Dr. Fam's excellent teaching style and well-structured course material, I found it to be a fascinating and rewarding learning experience. From revising the basics of signals and systems to diving deep into advanced topics such as Fourier-Transform and Multiresolution Analysis, this course provided me with a solid foundation and a comprehensive understanding of the subject. I also had the opportunity to apply the concepts I learned by developing a Fingerprint Image Restoration and classification program, which not only demonstrated the practical applications of DSP but also helped me improve my programming skills. Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone pursuing a career in engineering, as the concepts learned in DSP are widely used across various fields, and the skills acquired will undoubtedly be beneficial in the future.</br></br>

								<p style="font-size:33px;text-align:center">EE620 MIMO Wireless Communication</p>
								<p style="word-spacing:2px;"align="justify"> As a Bachelor's degree holder in communication engineering, I enrolled in the Master's program in Digital Communication at the University at Buffalo to further my knowledge in this field. The variety of courses offered caught my attention, including the EE620 Multiple-Input-Multiple-output(MIMO) wireless communication course. Through this course, I gained a deeper understanding of MIMO, its benefits, how it works, and different techniques. My goal was to enhance my career profile, as I aspire to work in wireless communication. In this reflection, I will discuss my experience in the course, challenges faced, and the impact on my career goals.</br></br>
									MIMO technology is a game changer in wireless communication, utilizing multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends to create multiple spatial channels for data transmission. This allows for faster data rates and improved reliability compared to traditional wireless communication systems. MIMO has become an essential technology for various wireless communication applications, especially in urban environments with poor signal quality due to interference and noise. </br></br>
									During the first few classes of the course, we extensively discussed the history of wireless communication, from the pioneering work of Marconi in 1901 to the modern-day cellular systems such as 5G. We also examined the evolution of wireless local area networks (WLAN) and the various IEEE 802.xx standards that define them. Specifically, we looked at the technical details of the IEEE 802.11 family of WLAN standards, including 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax, and discussed their respective features and capabilities. Additionally, we explored the different generations of cellular systems, starting from 1G all the way up to 5G, and the advancements made in each generation. This foundational understanding of the history and evolution of wireless communication provided us with a contextual framework that was essential in understanding the principles of MIMO wireless communication.</br></br>
									In the following classes, we dolve deeper into wireless communication concepts and reviewed the basics of Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) communication systems. We also represented various systems mathematically, including the channel model, which is crucial for MIMO system design. The motivation for MIMO systems was discussed in detail, including the need for increased spectral efficiency and higher data rates. With multiple antennas, a MIMO system can combat noise and fading by using spatial diversity techniques. The capacity of a MIMO system increases linearly with the minimum number of transmitter and receiver antennas, which is a key advantage of this technology. We also learned about different types of MIMO systems, such as Spatial Multiplexing (SM) and Space-Time Coding (STC), which use different techniques to achieve high capacity and reliability.</br></br>
									Through the course, I learned about the three distinct phenomena that affect radio signal propagation: path loss, shadowing, and multipath fading. Multipath fading, in particular, was a topic of interest, as it involves the signal taking multiple paths to reach the receiver, causing interference. The course discussed several fading models and their impact on MIMO systems in real-world scenarios. The understanding of fading is crucial in designing and optimizing wireless communication systems, ensuring reliable and robust communication, even in challenging environments.</br></br>

Specifically, we explored the concepts of channel estimation, channel equalization, and optimal resource allocation for MIMO-OFDM systems. Additionally, we analyzed different space-frequency coding schemes, such as Alamouti coding and space-time block coding, and their performance under different conditions. This part of the course was particularly interesting to me, as it provided a comprehensive understanding of how MIMO-OFDM systems can overcome various wireless communication challenges and achieve high data rates in broadband wireless networks. </br></br>
								As part of the course, we completed a final project that involved simulating various systems in MATLAB. One of the tasks was to implement and analyze different digital modulation schemes such as PAM, QAM, and PSK to optimize receiver detection. We then compared the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER) curves of these schemes. Additionally, we implemented a MIMO wireless system using Jake’s Fading Simulator to compare system performances (SER vs SNR curves) and determine the achieved diversity of the system. These projects not only improved my MATLAB skills but also added an additional skill-set to my professional profile, reflecting in my CV.</br></br>

These responsibilities required me to have technical expertise in RFID technology and associated software tools, problem-solving skills, communication skills, independence, and familiarity with industry-standard equipment.</p>

									During my time as a research assistant, I was able to improve my technical skills in RFID technology, simulation software, electron microscopy, and GNU Radio. Additionally, I developed my problem-solving skills through identifying and addressing printing issues, reducing interference, and optimizing tag designs. I also improved my communication skills by leading progress report and presentation sessions with sponsors and beneficiaries, and effectively conveying complex technical information. I gained independence and self-direction, as demonstrated by my self-teaching of embedded Python and development of an Out-of-Tree block in GNU Radio. Finally, I gained familiarity with industry-standard equipment, which may be useful in future projects or employment opportunities.
